# MxChartDB

The intent of this Z-Way module is to provide a quick and easy way to create
beautiful sensor logging graphs.  The data is stored in a database. The HTTP 
API allows it to be installed locally and on any system on the network. 
No internet service is required.

This package uses [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org) as database engine and 
[Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) as charting library.

## Prerequisites

SQLite with HTTP API. 
Everything you need for installation is included in this package (Linux only).

[HowTos](https://rawcdn.githack.com/piet66-peb/ZWay-MxChartDB/9422259/html/howtos.html)

## Installation

<del>Download and install the module and the API from the Z-Way App Store.
</del>

As the Z-Way management has been unresponsive, I have made my software 
available on GitHub. The version in the Z-Way App Store is now out of date.

- Download the package with wget from this site:
```sh
url=https://github.com/piet66-peb/ZWay-MxChartDB/raw/refs/heads/main/download_MxChartDB.bash
cd /tmp; wget -q -O - $url | sudo bash

```
- Restart Z-Way after the download to activate the package. 
- Then follow the installation procedure outlined in the HowTos.

## Upgrade

- Download the package with wget from this site:
```sh
url=https://github.com/piet66-peb/ZWay-MxChartDB/raw/refs/heads/main/download_MxChartDB.bash
cd /tmp; wget -q -O - $url | sudo bash

```
- If you have placed the HTTP_API in a different location, copy its contents there. 
- check the template files **constants_template.js** and **constants_template\.p**y
to see if you need to make any changes.
- Then restart MxChartDB_API.py and Z-Way.

### Remark

I always try to maintain backward compatibility. However, this is not 
always completely possible. You will recognise this in the graphics output 
or the chart configuration.  Simply correct it in the configuration.
