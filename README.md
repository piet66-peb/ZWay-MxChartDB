# MxChartDB

The intent of this Z-Way module is to provide a quick and easy way to create
beautiful sensor logging graphs.  The data is stored in a database. The HTTP 
API allows it to be installed locally and on any system on the network. 
No internet service is required.

This package uses [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org) as database engine and 
[Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) as charting library.

## Prerequisites

SQLite with HTTP API. 
Everything you need for installation is included in this package (Linux only).
