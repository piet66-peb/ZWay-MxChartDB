       <h1>Create a y-axis labeled with texts or images</h1>
       By default, MxChartDB uses linear Cartesian axes.
       <br><br>
       Additionally, it is also possible to define y-axes with text labels 
       or even with icons.
       <br><br>
       For each sensor, you can decide what type of labels to use. 
       The software automatically sets the type based on the sensor value: 
       <ul>
           <li>number labels for number values
           </li>
           <li>text/icon labels for text values. 
           </li>
       </ul>
       You can mix different kinds of y-axes in a graph, but you can't mix
       them for one sensor entry.
       <br><br>
       Proceeding for text/icon axes:
       <ul>
           <li>Make sure, that all sensor values are of type 'text'. If necessary, 
               change the type with sensor arithmetic, for example: <b>x+''</b>.
           </li>
           <li>Add the list of valid text labels to the 'Text Labels' field.
               The order in this field defines the order on the y-axis from top to down.
               You can embellish the output by using emoticons.
           </li>
           <li>Additional commas create gaps on the axis.
           </li>
           <li>All text labels must be unique. If necessary use invisible spaces.
           </li>
           <li>You can replace the text labels with images. Define then in the
               'Replace Text Labels with Icons' field. Make sure that the images
               have a 1:1 equivalent in the  'Text Labels' field.
           </li>
       </ul>
       If you have number and text axes on a page, they are combined into one 
       graph, unless the text axis has only two items. In this case, the 
       software creates a separate narrow graph at the bottom of the page.
