       <h1> Move a chart to a different database</h1>
       By default the data of all charts are stored in a database
       named <b>MxChartDB</b>, filename: MxChartDB.db.

       <br><br>For larger charts or charts with high-frequency writing, it may 
       make sense to use a separate database. You can specify a database of your
       choice in the Smart Home UI app definition. 

       <br><br>You can change this name at any time here. This will open 
       a new empty chart in the other database. The previously saved data 
       remains in the old location and is marked as 'orphaned'.

       <br><br>To move a complete chart with all the data saved so far to 
       another database, there is a special function in the 'Chart 
       Administration' page called '<b>Change Database</b>'. 

       <br><br>This function
       <ul>
           <li>stops the running chart instance</li>
           <li>copies the chart tables to the target database</li>
           <li>corrects the chart index</li>
           <li>enters the new database name in the instance definition</li>
           <li>deletes the chart tables in the source database</li>
           <li>restarts the chart instance</li>
       </ul>
   </body>
