       <h1> Move a chart to a different database</h1>
       Per default the data of all charts are stored into a database
       named <b>MxChartDB</b>, filename: MxChartDB.db.

       <br><br>For larger charts or charts with high-frequency writing, it may 
       make sense to use a separate database. You can enter a database of your choice
       in the app definition. 

       <br><br>You can change this name at any time here. This will open 
       a new empty chart in the other database. The previously stored data remains in 
       the old location and is marked as 'orphaned'.

       <br><br>To continue the chart in the new location with the old data, 
       you can clone it:
       <ol>
           <li>Clone the previoisly stored data:
           <ol>
               <li>Open the Chart Administration page.</li>
               <li>Deactivate the chart instance.</li>
               <Li>Clone the chart data. As target enter a string
                   <b>
                   &lt;new database&gt;.&lt;old chart id without database&gt;
                   </b></li>
           </ol>
           </li>
           <li>Change the database name in the app definition.</li>
           <li>Activate the chart instance again.</li>
           <li>Now you can delete the data from the old database.</li>
       </ol>
       It is necessary to clone the data first, because it won't overwrite
       existing data.
