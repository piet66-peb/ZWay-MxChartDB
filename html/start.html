       <h1>Start a New Graph</h1>
       The actual intention for this module was to provide the user with an
       easy option: simply add all his sensors to the list and the 
       software should take care of everything else.
       <br><br>
       However, due to years of development, the software has become ever 
       larger and more comprehensive. This makes it difficult to maintain 
       an overview.
       <br><br>
       Nevertheless, it is still possible to quickly create a new chart, as 
       there are default values for almost everything that make as much 
       sense as possible.
       <br><br>
       I recommend this approach:
       <ul>
           <li>As a first step, create a simple chart by defining only
               the chart title and adding your sensors to the list.
               Leave all other fields at their default values.
           </li>
           <li>Then run the chart and see how it looks like.
               In many cases this will be already enough.
           </li>
           <li>In further steps, you can make improvements to the chart, 
               e.g. change the appearance, the storage duration, etc. 
               Or add more sensors to the end of the list.
           </li>
       </ul>
       You can change everything until you are really satisfied, except 
       the order of the sensors.
