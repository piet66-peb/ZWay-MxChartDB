       <h1>Free space in database files</h1>
       In SQLite, when you delete or update data, the space it occupied 
       in the database file is not immediately reclaimed. Instead, the 
       space is added to the free-list and made available for reuse by new data.
       <br><br>
       It would be inefficient to return these pages to the operating system 
       only to reassign them later. And in practice, deleting a lot of data 
       doesn't usually happen during normal operation. 
       <br><br>
       In exceptional cases, there may be a reason to reorganize the database 
       file.  Sqlite therefore provides the command
       <a href='https://www.sqlite.org/lang_vacuum.html'>vacuum</a> 
       <br><br>
       The HTTP API command <b>&lt;db&gt;/rebuild_db</b> executes it.
       <br><br>
       It's not yet testet!!
       Use at your own risk. It is recommended to stop all applications
       and make a backup before.
