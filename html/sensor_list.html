       <h1>Do Changes in the Sensor List</h1>
      You can always add more sensors to the end of the sensor list.
      <br><br>
      However once the first data is stored in the database, 
      it is not possible to change the order of the existing sensors.
      <br><br>
      To remove a sensor, you can disable it by checking the appropriate 
      box in the list.<br><br>
      You can also reuse this entry by exchanging the device.
      <br>
      To ensure that this is done intentionally, it is necessary to 
      confirm this change by checking the 'Continue current chart 
      with new devices' box.
      <br><br>
      Or, if you don't need the data anymore, you can restart the 
      chart with a blank state after deleting the old values.
