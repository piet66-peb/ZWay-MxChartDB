       <h1>Special case: <i>database is locked/busy</i></h1>
       It may happen that the '<i>database is locked/busy</i>' warning appears 
        when storing new sensor values.
        <br><br>
        This is not a problem. No data will be lost.
        <br><br>
        This is because the API is multithreaded, but the SQLite engine is not. 
        If there are too many write requests to the same database (file) at once, 
        the engine will temporarily lock that database for further writes.
        <br><br>
        The client removes the data from the send buffer only after it is 
        acknowledged. Until this happens, the data is always re-sent on the 
        next write. 
        <br><br>
        If the data has been saved in the meantime, a warning '<i>UNIQUE constraint 
         failed: MxChartDBxxx.ts</i>' is written to the log file. This message
        may be useful for analysis.
        <br><br>
        The maximum number of repetitions can be defined in the constants.js file
        (parameter <b>buffer_max_rows</b>, default: 20).
        <br><br>
        To avoid the '<i>database is locked/busy</i>' events, you can
        <ul>
            <li>reduce the write frequency of your chart instances</li>
            <li>enhance the <b>TIMEOUT</b> parameter in constants.py</li>
            <li>use different databases<br>see also:

            </li>
