       <h1>Warning: Database Locked</h1>
       It may happen that the warning 'Database is locked' appears when 
       storing new sensor values.

       It is because the API is multithreaded, but the SQLite engine is not. 
       If too many requests arrive at once, the engine temporarily locks the 
       database for further write operations.
       <br><br>
       This is not a problem, as the client only removes the data from the 
       buffer once it has been acknowledged. As long as this does not happen, 
       the data is always sent again with the next write operation. Data is 
       therefore not lost.
       <br>
       The maximum number of repetitions can be defined in the constants.js file.
       <br><br>
       It is worth considering using a separate database file for charts with 
       large amounts of data.
       By default, the data for all charts together is stored in a database 
       (file) with the name MxChartDB.
