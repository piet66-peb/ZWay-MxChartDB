       <h1>Warning: database is locked/ busy</h1>
       It may happen that the warning 'Database is locked' appears when 
       storing new sensor values.
       <br><br>
       That is not a problem. No data are lost.
       <br><br>
       It is because the API is multithreaded, but the SQLite engine is not. 
       If too many write requests for the same database (file) arrive at once, 
       the engine temporarily locks this database for further write operations.
       <br><br>
       The client only removes the data from the 
       buffer once it has been acknowledged. As long as this does not happen, 
       the data is always sent again with the next write operation.
       <br><br>
       The maximum number of repetitions can be defined in the constants.js file.
       <br><br>
       It is worth considering using a separate database file for charts with 
       large amounts of data, <br>see also:
