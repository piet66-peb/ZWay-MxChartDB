       <h1>Special case: <i>database is locked/busy</i></h1>
       It may happen that the '<i>database is locked/busy</i>' warning appears 
        when saving new sensor values.
        <br><br>
        This is not a problem. No data is lost.
        <br><br>
        It is because the API is multithreaded, but the SQLite engine is not. 
        If there are too many write requests to the same database (file) at once, 
        the engine will temporarily lock that database for further writes.
        <br><br>
        The client removes the data from the send buffer only after it is acknowledged. 
        As long as this does not happen, the data is always sent again with the 
        next write operation.
        <br><br>
        If the data has been saved in the meantime, a warning '<i>UNIQUE constraint 
            failed: MxChartDBxxx.ts</i>' is written to the log file. This message can 
        be useful for analysis.
        <br><br>
        The maximum number of repetitions can be defined in the constants.js file.
        <br><br>
        For charts with large amounts of data or frequent writes, it is recommended to use a separate 
        database file, <br>see also:
